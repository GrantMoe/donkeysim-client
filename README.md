# donkeysim-client

![Demo lap animated gif](./demo_lap.gif)  

Sends commands to and records data from an [OpenAI Gym Environments for Donkey Car](https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar) server. ([more info](https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/))

Can currently record telemetry and image data in formats required for
* [Donkey Car ("tub" format)](https://www.donkeycar.com/)
* [OpenVSLAM](https://github.com/OpenVSLAM-Community/openvslam)
* [my DSI capstone (CSV)](https://github.com/GrantMoe/DSI-Capstone-Project)

Ever-evolving, always in flux. Mildy messy at the moment.
